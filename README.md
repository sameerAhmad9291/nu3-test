We need you to develop a web interface where we can upload xml or csv files and write them to a database.

###### Requirements:

A form where users can upload files to update products (from an XML file) or inventory status (from a CSV file) via a web interface.
Content of the files should be inserted to a database table. (You can use the "handle‚Äù to create a relation between product and inventory)
Previously uploaded files (an upload history) are listed under the upload form.
Unit tests
Supported file types are *.csv and *.xml
All code must be on a public VCS.
Optional:

###### Webhooks:
A request to given url after every single row update.
